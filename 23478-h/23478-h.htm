<h1>SELF-DENIAL;</h1>

<h3>OR,</h3>

<h2>ALICE WOOD, AND HER<br />
MISSIONARY SOCIETY.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
<img src="images/i001.jpg" width="481" height="404" alt="Alice&#39;s Missionary Society" title="" />
</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> village school-house was
situated on a pretty green, and surrounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
by old elm-trees, and at
a short distance and in full sight
was a candy-shop, kept by an old
woman, whom the children called
Mother Grimes. Mother Grimes
knew how to make the very best
candies and cakes that ever were
eaten, and almost every day she
displayed in her shop-window some
new kind of cake, or some new
variety of candy, to excite the curiosity
or tempt the palates of her
little customers, who found it a
very difficult matter to pass Mother
Grimes's shop on their way from
school.</p>

<p>One day, just after the school-bell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
rang to give notice of the recess,
a pretty little girl, by the name
of Alice Wood, was seen very
busily running about among the
school-girls and whispering to one
and another. Her object was to
induce them to remain a little while
after the school, as she had something
to propose to them. Alice
was a great favourite, as she was always
willing to put herself to any
inconvenience for the sake of giving
any one else pleasure. So they all
readily consented to stay, if it were
only to please her.</p>

<p>After school was out and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
teacher had left, Alice collected
the girls together and told them her
plan. "Girls," said she, "last night
I went to the missionary meeting,
and some of you were there too.
We heard a missionary speak, who
has just come back from India, and
he told us of the millions of poor
degraded and ignorant people there,
who have never heard of God or
the Bible, and who worship idol
gods of wood and stone, and sacrifice
their children and themselves
to these dumb idols; and he told
us of millions in other countries
who are just as ignorant and degraded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
besides the multitudes in
our own land who know nothing
of the Bible or the way of salvation.
I knew all this before, to be sure,
for I have often heard it; but I
never <i>felt</i> it as I did last night; and
when the missionary called upon us
children and told us that we could
do something to save these immortal
souls, I felt, for the first time in
my life, that it was my duty, by
denying myself some gratifications
and by trying to save money in
other ways, to do all that I could
to send the word of God to those
who are perishing. Girls," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
she, with earnestness, "I could
hardly sleep last night, for I was
all the time going over in my mind
the different ways in which I might
earn or save something, and I
thought if all our school were to
feel as I did, and join me in this,
we might collect a great many dollars
a year."</p>

<p>Here some of the older girls began
to whisper to each other that
they had no money to spare, and
that their parents could not give
them money every day to send to
the heathen.</p>

<p>"Now stop a little while, girls,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
if you please," said Alice, "till I
just tell you what I want to have
done. In the first place, I think
it will be so pleasant to form a
sewing Society, to meet on Saturday
afternoons, and make bags and
needle-cases and collars and many
other things to sell; and I know
my father will be delighted to have
us put a box, with these things, in
his store. Then, while we sew, I
propose that one reads aloud from
some interesting book or paper
about missions and benevolent societies,
and thus we shall all become
interested in the intelligence, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
be more willing to work and save
to help the needy." Alice then,
with a great deal of tact, proposed
the names of those who should be
President, Secretary, and Treasurer
of their Society, selecting the
very ones who had been opposed
to her plan. One large girl was
still dissatisfied, and declared she
would not join them, till Alice
moved that she should be appointed
reader. This delighted
her very much, as she read remarkably
well; and now all were
pleased, and Alice went on with
her plan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, about our laying up money,
girls," said she. "I believe our
parents are none of them very rich,
and yet we contrive to get a great
many pennies, in one way or another,
to spend for our own gratification.
How many pennies do
you think go, in a year, from our
school into Mother Grimes's pocket?
Why enough to send a great many
Bibles to the destitute. Perhaps
enough to support a missionary, or
educate a heathen child, or give a
library or two to a poor Sunday-school.
Just think of it, girls!
Now I, for one, spend certainly a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
penny a day for candy. How
many will that be in a year, Susy?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred and sixty-five,"
answered little Susy Barnes.</p>

<p>"Yes; three dollars and sixty-five
cents will buy a great many
Bibles and good books," said Alice;
"and then my father gives me a
penny a week for slate pencils.
Now I am going to ask him to continue
the penny a week; and then
I am going to see how long I can
keep a pencil, for I have been very
careless in losing them. And in
these, and other ways, I hope I
can save quite a sum of money in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a year. Now, girls, will you all
think, between this time and tomorrow
noon, how much you can
save, and then we will put it all
down together, and see how much
we can hope to collect in a year?"</p>

<p>The girls readily promised, and
then, as they had stayed a long time,
they all set off in haste for their
homes, full of the new project of
the Missionary Society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>PART II.</h2>


<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> next day, as soon as school
was out, the little girls, of their own
accord, crowded around Alice,
who stood with a pencil and piece
of paper in her hand, ready to put
down their names, and the sums
they each thought she could save.
Several of them thought they could
save a penny a day, instead of
giving it to Mother Grimes; some
a penny a week, and some a penny
a month. Alice told them, that if
some of them could only give a penny
a year, she would gladly take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that; and then, that they might not
be ashamed of giving so little, she
read to them the story of the
"widow's mite." And when the
girls laughed, because one little
girl, whose mother was very poor,
said, "She would bring a penny <i>if
she could ever get one</i>," Alice kissed
her, and said,</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Kitty, your penny will
be as acceptable, and do more
good, than hundreds of dollars
from some very rich man who
does not miss it at all. At any
rate you shall come into our Society
and help us sew."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Rachel Brown said "she was
sure <i>she</i> did not spend much
money for candy."</p>

<p>"No! and why not, Miss Sugar-tooth?"
said little Susy Barnes;
"because you always keep close to
Alice Wood, as you go home from
school, and you know that the one
that is nearest to her will always
have half of her candy."</p>

<p>"Hush, Susy," said Alice, "I
can tell you that no one will have
half of my candy after this, as I do
not intend to buy any; and I am
sure Rachel can save a good deal
if she chooses, for our Society."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Clara Hall said, her father had
promised her a quarter of a dollar
if she would have an ugly double
tooth drawn, that had ached for
some time.</p>

<p>"But," said Clara, "the provoking
thing aches the worst at
night, and then I think I will certainly
have it out in the morning,
but when the morning comes it is
sure to stop aching." Once or twice
she said she had gone to the dentist's
door, but her courage failed.
"But," said she, "Alice, the very
next time it aches as hard in the
day as it does sometimes in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
night, I shall come with the tooth
in one hand, and the quarter of a
dollar in the other, for the Society."</p>

<p>Sally Bright said, their next
neighbour had cut her hand very
badly, and had promised her a
penny a day, for milking her cow
for her, as long as her hand continued
lame; and those pennies
should all come to Alice.</p>

<p>Charlotte Green said, her father
had promised her half a dollar if
she would leave off biting her
nails. "And now," said she, "I
mean to try in earnest to break myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of this habit, that I may have
something too to give."</p>

<p>"Well, girls," said Jane Prime,
"my father, you know, keeps a
large nursery, and he gives me
three cents a quart for peach stones
and plum stones; and he says he
will pay that for as many as are
brought to him. So here is a fine
way for any of you that choose to
make money, as long as fruit lasts."</p>

<p>Alice Wood now reckoned up
the promised sums, and said,</p>

<p>"I think, girls, if we all keep the
resolutions we have formed, that
by only saving the money that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
we should spend in other ways,
and giving it to the society, we
can pledge ourselves to give altogether
fifty dollars a year; and
with our Sewing Society, and the
many other ways that have been
mentioned of earning a little money,
I should not be surprised
if we should raise it to one hundred
dollars a year. Just think
what a sum that would be, and
how much good it may do, if we
give it in a right spirit, and with
prayers for the blessing of God to
accompany it. For you know the
missionary said the other evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that we might give a great deal of
money, merely for the sake of having
it published, or from some other
improper motive, and if it should
do good to others, it would not do
any to ourselves; but that even a little
given from a right motive, and
with fervent prayer for the Divine
blessing, might accomplish great
things, and would return in mercy
upon the head of the giver. For,
said he, (and these words are from
the Bible,) 'He that hath pity upon
the poor, <i>lendeth</i> unto the Lord,
and that which he hath given, <i>will
he pay him again</i>.' And, 'The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
liberal soul shall be made fat, and
he that watereth, shall <i>himself be
watered</i>.'"</p>

<p>As the girls went home, they all
kept on the side of the road opposite
to Mother Grimes's shop; for
the old woman had a bad temper,
and a very loud voice, and they
were all afraid of hearing from her
if they passed her shop without
stopping to buy something.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter
with the children?" said old Mother
Grimes to herself. "Here, these two
or three days past, hardly a soul of
them has been near the shop, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
my candies are getting quite old."
And Mother Grimes went to work,
and cracked nuts, and boiled new
molasses, and made nicer candies
than ever; but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>Rachel Brown did say to Alice
Wood one day, "See, Alice, what
beautiful candy Mother Grimes has
put in her shop-window to day."
But Alice only said, "Rachel, we
have now a better use for our
money; let us waste nothing, but
save all we can, so that we shall
not feel, when we meet our fellow-creatures
at the last day, that any
of them have perished through our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
neglect, or because we were so
selfish that we could not deny ourselves
a small gratification for the
sake of supplying their need."</p>

<p>One day a knot of little girls
were so bold as to pass directly by
the candy shop. The old woman
stood in the door, and called out
to them as they passed, and asked
them why they never stopped now.
"See," said she, "all my nice candies
melting in the sun; and nobody
but the flies to eat them."</p>

<p>"We have found something
better to do with our pennies,
Mother Grimes," answered little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Susy Barnes, who was the leader
of the party, "than to spend them
in getting the tooth-ache, and making
ourselves sick; and we have
all made up our minds that we
will not buy any more candy."
The old woman flew into a passion,
and talked so loud, that
some of the little girls were for
running off, but Susy stood her
ground undaunted.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Mother
Grimes," said she, "if you will
give up selling candy, and keep
slates, and pencils, and pens, and
sponges, and all such useful things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
for sale, we shall all be much more
likely to stop here, than to go all
the way round to the booksellers."</p>

<p>But Mother Grimes's wrath only
increased the more, and as she
showed some signs of coming out
after them, Susy was glad to join
the retreating party; and they all
darted off without looking behind
them, and did not consider themselves
perfectly safe, till they were
seated at their desks in the schoolroom.
Mother Grimes soon found
that it was useless to try to tempt
the little school-children any more,
so she determined to move off to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
some other place, "where," as she
said, "the children had no such
foolish notions in their heads."</p>

<p>And now the Sewing Society
was started; and such a cutting
and fixing, and bustle as there
was, till enough work was prepared
to give them all something to do!
And then, when the one appointed
began to read to them the interesting
accounts from the papers,
even those that at first felt no interest,
but joined merely for the sake
of being made officers in the Society,
became so much interested, that
they too were willing to practise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
great self-denial for the sake of
aiding in sending the gospel to the
destitute. And now who can estimate
the good that one such little
Society may accomplish? It is
like casting a little pebble into the
smooth water; at first small circles
are formed about the spot, but they
widen and increase, till we cannot
see where the influence of that little
pebble upon the water ends.
So it may be with this little Society,
but we shall never know, till
the secrets of the last great day are
disclosed, how much good such
an association may have accomplished;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
how many souls the Bibles
thus sent forth may have converted;
and then, too, how much good
these converts may have done in
teaching the way of life to others,
and these again to hundreds and
thousands more!</p>

<p>Children, is it not worth while
to try and see if you cannot yourselves
do something, and induce
others to join you, and see how
much money you can save, and
make in the coming year? Do
not ask your parents for money
just to throw into a box, but give
that which you would have spent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in some other way. And then see
if you have not ingenuity enough
to find out some plan of earning
money for the sake of doing good
with it. Depend upon it, your
interest in benevolent objects will
increase from the very moment
that you deny yourself for the sake
of giving to others. Think what it
would be to have even <i>one soul</i>
saved from among the poor benighted
heathen, to rise up in the
last great day, and call you, yes
<i>you</i>, my little reader, blessed. Try
it, and with daily prayers for the
blessing of God upon your efforts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
see what you can do for the heathen;
remembering, that "he that
converteth a <i>single</i> sinner from the
error of his way, shall save a <i>soul
from death</i>, and shall hide a multitude
of sins."</p>

<h2><i>Good Resolutions.</i></h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Though</span> I'm now in younger days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor can tell what shall befall me,</span><br />
I'll prepare for every place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where my growing age shall call me.</span><br />
<br />
Should I e'er be rich or great,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Others shall partake my goodness:</span><br />
I'll supply the poor with meat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never showing scorn nor rudeness.</span><br />
<br />
Where I see the blind or lame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deaf or dumb, I'll kindly treat them;</span><br />
I deserve to feel the same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I mock, or hurt, or cheat them.</span><br />
<br />
If I meet with railing tongues,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why should I return them railing?</span><br />
Since I best revenge my wrongs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By my patience never failing.</span><br />
<br />
When I hear them telling lies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Talking foolish, cursing, swearing,</span><br />
First I'll try to make them wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or I'll soon go out of hearing.</span><br />
<br />
What though I be low and mean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll engage the rich to love me;</span><br />
While I'm modest, neat, and clean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And submit when they reprove me.</span><br />
<br />
If I should be poor and sick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall meet, I hope, with pity;</span><br />
Since I love to help the weak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though they're neither fair nor witty.</span><br />
<br />
I'll not willingly offend,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor be easily offended;</span><br />
What's amiss I'll strive to mend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And endure what can't be mended.</span><br />
<br />
May I be so watchful still<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er my humours and my passion,</span><br />
As to speak, and do no ill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though it should be all the fashion.</span><br />
<br />
Wicked fashions lead to hell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ne'er may I be found complying</span><br />
But in life behave so well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not to be afraid of dying.</span><br />
